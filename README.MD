Welcome to Ken's Beach House Adventure!

This week, a group of friends and I travelled to Florida to take classes online in warm weather during the pandemic. It's quite a place, with a guest house, pool, garage and main house. I'll be recreating the house in the interactive ficiton game, with a couple of my friends as characters, where the goal is to unlock the garage shed and get access to the incredibly fun Jetski. I'd be careful with the gas controls.
